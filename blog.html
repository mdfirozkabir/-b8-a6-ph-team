                <p class="mt-2">
                    In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different
                    scopes
                    and behavior. Understanding their scope is essential to writing clean and predictable code
                </p>

                <p class="mt-10">1. var:
                    - Function-scoped: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that they are
                    accessible throughout the function in which they are declared, even before the actual declaration
                    (call).
                    - Lifting: variable declarations using var are lifted to the top of the function or to the global
                    context, but their assignments remain in place.</p>



                <p class="mt-10">
                    2. let'':
                    - Block-scoped: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, i.e. they are limited to the block,
                    statement or expression in which they are defined.
                    - hoisting: Like var, let is hoisted, but unlike var, it is not initialized, so referring to
                    it
                    before declaration causes a reference error'.
                </p>


                <p class="mt-10">3. 'const':
                    - Block-scoped: Like let', const' is also block-scoped.
                    - Immutability: Variables declared with 'const' cannot be reassigned once a value has been assigned.
                    However, for objects and arrays, the properties or elements within them can still be modified.
                    - Hoisting: const variables are also hoisted but, like let, they are not initialized until
                    declared.

                        undefined?<br><span>ans:</span></h1>
                    <p>In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct values that are often used to represent
                        the
                        absence of a meaningful value or the absence of an assigned value. They serve different purposes
                        and
                        have specific use cases:
                    </p><br>

                    <p>1. null:
                        - Explicitly assigned: You can assign null to a variable or property to indicate that it has
                        no
                        meaningful value.
                        - Used as a placeholder: It can be used as a placeholder value when you expect a variable or
                        property to hold an object or value later, but it doesn't currently have one.
                        - Comparisons: null can be used in comparisons to check if a variable or property has been
                        intentionally set to represent the absence of a value.</p> <br>


                    <p>
                        2. undefined:
                        - Default value: Variables that are declared but not assigned a value are automatically
                        initialized
                        with undefined. Function parameters that are not provided a value are also undefined by
                        default.
                        - Missing properties: When you access an object's property that doesn't exist, it returns
                        undefined.
                        - Absence of return value: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns
                        undefined.
                    </p>


                    <p>In summary, null is typically used when you want to indicate that a variable or property
                        intentionally has no value, while undefined often represents the absence of an assigned value
                        or
                        missing properties. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for writing clean and reliable
                        JavaScript code.

                    <p>
                        REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a
                        set
                        of architectural principles and constraints for designing and interacting with web services.
                        REST is
                        not a technology or protocol itself but rather a style of designing networked applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        1. **Stateless**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed
                        to
                        understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any client-specific context.

                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        2. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities that communicate
                        over
                        a network. This separation allows for scalability and flexibility in development.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        3. **Uniform Interface**: RESTful APIs have a consistent and well-defined set of operations,
                        such as
                        GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), etc. This
                        uniformity simplifies both the client and server components.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        4. **Resource-Based**: Resources (e.g., data objects or entities) are identified by URLs
                        (Uniform
                        Resource Locators). In REST, everything is a resource, and each resource is uniquely
                        addressable.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        5. **Representation**: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or
                        others. Clients interact with these representations to manipulate resources.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        RESTful APIs are commonly used in web development to enable communication between different
                        software systems over the internet. They are known for their simplicity, scalability, and ease
                        of use, making them a popular choice for building web services and APIs.</p>
